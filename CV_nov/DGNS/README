In contrast to the Segmenter partitions, these are not organized by train/test
because the model has not been yet decided. Can be done within model script.

These partitions are organized by pathology: Malignants, Benigns and Converts which
have a different pathology depending on risk prediction time-frame.

The proper label assignment of the converts has to be done using the triples
spreadsheet:
